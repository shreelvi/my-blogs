                    Directives in Angular are classes that adds an additional behavior to elements in Angular applications. 
                    The directive class is decorated with <code class="inline-code">@Directive </code> decorator
                    Directive changes the apperance or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components with attribute directives.
                    More Info on <a href="https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives" target="_blank">Directives</a>.
                    <br><br>Directives are useful in our web applications in many cases, we can use it to manage forms, lists, styles and the UI apperance of web pages.
                    In this article, We will also see how we can make use of attribute directive class to add auto-focus in Login Page. This directive can be used throghout our application to add auto-focus function anywhere as needed.

                    There are different types of directives in Angular. <Strong>Components</Strong> is the most common directive type which is a directive with template.
                    There are <strong>built-in attribute directives </strong>that Angular provides which modifies the behavior of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components.
                </p>
                
                <p class="article-paragraph">                  
                    Some of the common built-in attribute directives are <code class="inline-code">NgClass</code> 
                    which adds and removes CSS classes. <code class="inline-code">NgStyle</code> 
                    which adds and removes a set of HTML styles. <code class="inline-code">NgModel</code> that adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element. 
                    There is also <strong>Structural Directive</strong>. We will not go through them in detail here but you can find more info at link provided above.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    In this article, we will focus on Attribute Directive and creating one. As explained before, <strong>Attribute Directives</strong> in Angular are responsible for changing the apperanace or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components. 
                    Here, we will create a directive to add Auto-focus in the login form. In other words, we will create a directive to change the behavior of our HTML form. 
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Next, let us discuss about creating a Custom Attribute Directive in our Angular Application.
                    The main use case is to implement auto-focus to our login page so user should not move mouse curser to the input box. Let's look for the code to accomplish this.
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    We could add auto-focus to an input field simply by using the "autofocus" attribute from HTML form. 
                    
                </p>

                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="code-block">
                      {{snippet1}}
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    This works fine with HTML pages but with Angular applications, this does not work when you move from one page to other.
                    When user is logged out and it redirects to login page, this does not work. 
                    This issue is caused because Autofocus feature of html5 only runs when the first time page loads as in SPA all scripts are loaded at first.  
                </p>

                <p class="article-header">
                    Let's build the attribute directive 
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    We will use Angular CLI to create a directive <code class="inline-code">ng generate directive auto-focus</code>
                    The CLI creates <code class="inline-code">src/app/auto-focus.directive.ts</code>. It also updates our AppModule.
                    <br> <br> Let's update our directive file which should look like below snippet:
                </p>

                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="code-block">
                      {{snippet2}}
        
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Here, we are using <code>@Directive</code> Decorator to define our directive.
                    It specifies the directive's CSS attribute selector, [matInputFocus]. 
                    <br> <br> We add <code>MatInput</code> from <code>@angular/material/input</code> in the directive's constructor which provides a reference to the host DOM element, MATINPUT where we want to add <code>AutoFocus</code>.
                    The logic in the constructor sets the focus on the selected MAT INPUT HTML element.
                    
                    <br><br> We will then use this as an HTML element attribute like below wherever we require auto focus feature in our application by just adding the selector <strong>matInputFocus</strong> in Mat-Input elements.
                    <br><br> First, lets Import the Directive component in the app module or in the Module where we want to use it. 
                    In this example, we are using it in the Login component, so we will import this directive in our module like: 
                </p>

                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="code-block">
                      {{snippet4}}
        
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Finally, update the login form.
                </p>

                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="code-block">
                      {{snippet3}}
        
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Angular creates an instance of the Directive class we created and provides a reference to the 
                    <code>input</code> element into the directive's constructor which sets the focus.
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    In the same way, you can create custom attribute directives to change the apperance or behavior of your page.
                    We can handle user events to use directives, pass custom values from user input into attribute directives.
                    
                    <br> <br> For example: we can create highlight directive to highlight an HTML element on mouse-hover, mouse-click. We can get color that we want to highlight from user and pass it to the directive to apply the selection.
                </p>

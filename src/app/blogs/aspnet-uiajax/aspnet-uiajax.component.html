                    In this tutorial, we will see how we can work with Data in ASP.NET MVC using Sqlite database and EF core.
                    Working with data is a major step in developing a web app and as a developer we come across this all the time.
                    We store the webapp data in its database for storage and we retrieve and work with it using C# LINQ in ASP.NET MVC framework.
                    Then, we present and list the data from various sources such database tables, fetch from APIs, and present it in a views in Razor pages.

                    This tutorial will show you how to make basic reporting particularly for the Admins/Masters to manage 
                    the product details. We will get a chance to work with data in various common data scenarios as master details provide us with 
                    chance to manage data and do tasks such as CRUD for our records in the database.
                </p>

                    We are going to use .NET 6.0 version for our web application, the data layer will be developed in Sqlite database which
                    is light-weight database intended for development purposes. And on the back-end, we will use EF core 6.0 with LINQ to query 
                    the database as c# objects. We will not go into much detail in the database layer and c#/EF code for accessing the database objects,
                    rather this will be more of a focus on the presentation-layer as we will explore techniques to utilize Javascript, JQuery and Ajax 
                    for seamless user experience and listing the data as a table, we will use bootstrap for stylings.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    We will need to install three packages for this tutorial in order to use EF Core and Sqlite, and install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.design
                    in order to run commands to create migrations and update database tables.
                    Required packages are as follows and code to install them using dotnet CLI. <br>
                    <code class="inline-code">dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore</code><br>
                    <code class="inline-code">dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite</code><br>
                    <code class="inline-code">dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.design</code><br><br>

                    
                    Directives in Angular are classes that adds an additional behavior to elements in Angular applications. 
                    The directive class is decorated with <code class="inline-code">@Directive </code> decorator
                    Directive changes the apperance or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components with attribute directives.
                    More Info on <a href="https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives" target="_blank">Directives</a>.
                    <br><br>Directives are useful in our web applications in many cases, we can use it to manage forms, lists, styles and the UI apperance of web pages.
                    In this article, We will also see how we can make use of attribute directive class to add auto-focus in Login Page. This directive can be used throghout our application to add auto-focus function anywhere as needed.

                    The model/entity classes for this example are in the following code.

                    Now, we will define our database context class. In .Net 6.0, to create a database connection we will override OnConfiguring method and pass the connection string from the appsettings file as below.
                    We used the startup class in .Net 5.0 to do this and we might encounter the error that the connection is not configured in the context class. Then, we will need to update our Program.cs class to set dependency injection with service container.

                    This will install migration scripts that will be used for creating the database in Data folder. Adding --verbose will give us detail if we get any error.
